checklist for basic game setup
1. define each card type -- copper, silver, gold, estate, duchy, province, curse (don't
    actually need yet), cellar, market, merchant, militia, mine, moat, remodel, smithy, village, workshop
    ***** this is probably the trickiest part -- figuring out how to handle the unique action cards might be tough

2. build Game instance -- Players, PlayerDecks, BasicCards, KingdomCards

3. shuffle decks, players each draw 5 cards 

4. ON A PLAYER'S TURN THEY CAN: ---> this will be a loop that repeats WHILE (!GameWon)
    a. start with 1 action, 1 buy
    b. play action cards first (play some, none, or all -- depends on number of actions
        player has, player can choose to not play an action if they want)
    c. play treasure cards & buy until either they 1) run out of buys, 2) run out of money
        3) don't want to buy anything else
    d. end turn
    e. draw 5 new cards from (shuffling when draw pile is empty)

5. WIN CONDITIONS:
    a. if Province pile is depleted OR 
    b. if 3 piles of KingdomCards are depleted 
    c. should be checked at the end of every turn 
    d. when true, player with highest VP wins
